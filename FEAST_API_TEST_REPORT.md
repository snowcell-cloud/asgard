## Detailed Test Results

### ‚úÖ Test 0: API Health Check

**Status:** PASS  
**Result:** API is reachable at http://51.89.225.64

### ‚úÖ Test 1: Get Feature Store Status

**Status:** PASS  
**Response:**

```json
{
  "registry_type": "local",
  "online_store_type": "disabled",
  "offline_store_type": "file (S3 Parquet - Iceberg native storage)",
  "num_feature_views": 0,
  "num_entities": 0,
  "num_feature_services": 0,
  "feature_views": [],
  "entities": []
}
```

**Analysis:**

- ‚úÖ Feast service is running and operational
- ‚úÖ Configured for offline store only (online disabled as expected)
- ‚úÖ Using S3 Parquet with Iceberg integration
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è No feature views or entities registered yet

---

### ‚úÖ Test 2: List Feature Views

**Status:** PASS  
**Result:** Empty list `[]`

**Analysis:**

- ‚úÖ API endpoint working correctly
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è No feature views have been created yet (expected for fresh instance)

---

### ‚ùå Test 3: Create Feature View

**Status:** FAIL  
**Error:**

```
Failed to create feature view: When getting information for key
'iceberg/gold/customer_aggregates/data/*.parquet' in bucket 'airbytedestination1':
AWS Error UNKNOWN (HTTP status 301) during HeadObject operation: No response body.
Looks like the configured region is '' while the bucket is located in 'eu-north-1'.
```

**Root Cause:**

- AWS S3 region is not configured in the Feast feature_store.yaml
- The bucket 'airbytedestination1' is in 'eu-north-1' but Feast is trying to access with empty region

**Fix Required:**
Update `feature_store.yaml` to include:

```yaml
offline_store:
  type: file
  path: s3://airbytedestination1/iceberg/gold
  region: eu-north-1 # Add this line
```

---

### ‚ùå Test 4: Create Feature Service

**Status:** FAIL  
**Error:**

```json
{
  "detail": "Feature view 'test_customer_features' not found"
}
```

**Root Cause:**

- Depends on Test 3 (Create Feature View) which failed
- Cannot create a feature service without existing feature views

---

### ‚ùå Test 5: Train ML Model

**Status:** FAIL  
**Error:**

```
Model training failed: Execution failed on sql:
SELECT DISTINCT customers, event_date, churned
FROM iceberg.gold.customers
WHERE event_date BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2025-09-13...' AND TIMESTAMP '2025-10-13...'

TrinoUserError(type=USER_ERROR, name=TABLE_NOT_FOUND,
message="line 6:18: Table 'iceberg.gold.customers' does not exist",
query_id=20251013_123951_00002_yb5wr)
```

**Root Cause:**

- Test table 'iceberg.gold.customers' does not exist in the database
- Need to use actual existing tables from the gold layer

**Fix Required:**

- Query available tables first: `GET /data-transformation/tables`
- Use existing table names for training

---

### ‚úÖ Test 6: List Models

**Status:** PASS  
**Result:** Empty list `[]`

**Analysis:**

- ‚úÖ API endpoint working correctly
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è No models trained yet (expected since training failed)

---

### ‚ùå Test 7: Batch Predictions

**Status:** FAIL  
**Error:**

```json
{
  "detail": "Model test-model-id not found"
}
```

**Root Cause:**

- Depends on Test 5 (Train Model) which failed
- No trained model available for prediction

---

## Issues Identified

### üî¥ Critical Issues

1. **AWS S3 Region Not Configured**

   - **Location:** `feature_store.yaml` (Feast configuration)
   - **Impact:** Cannot read from S3/Iceberg tables
   - **Priority:** HIGH
   - **Fix:** Add `region: eu-north-1` to offline_store configuration

2. **Test Data Tables Missing**
   - **Impact:** Cannot demonstrate full workflow with test data
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM
   - **Fix:** Use actual tables from gold layer or create sample tables

### üü° Configuration Recommendations

1. **Feature Store Initialization**

   - Currently no feature views registered
   - Recommend creating feature views for existing gold tables
   - Setup feature services for common ML use cases

2. **Model Storage**
   - Verify MODEL_STORAGE_PATH is accessible and writable
   - Current path: `/tmp/models` (ephemeral in containers)
   - Consider using S3 for persistent model storage

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Fix S3 Region Configuration**

   ```bash
   # Edit the Feast configuration
   vim /tmp/feast_repo/feature_store.yaml

   # Add region to offline_store section:
   offline_store:
     region: eu-north-1
   ```

2. **Discover Available Tables**

   ```bash
   # Query available gold layer tables
   curl http://51.89.225.64/data-transformation/tables
   ```

3. **Re-run Tests with Real Data**
   ```bash
   python3 test_feast_api_with_discovery.py
   ```

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Persistent Model Storage**

   - Move from `/tmp/models` to S3 bucket
   - Add model versioning
   - Implement model registry

2. **Feature View Setup**

   - Create feature views for key business entities
   - Setup feature services for common ML patterns
   - Document feature definitions

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Add health checks for S3 connectivity
   - Monitor feature freshness
   - Track model performance metrics

## Test Scripts

Two test scripts have been created:

1. **`test_feast_api_production.py`** - Complete endpoint testing

   - Tests all Feast API endpoints
   - Uses sample test data
   - Generates comprehensive report

2. **`test_feast_api_with_discovery.py`** - Adaptive testing
   - Discovers available tables automatically
   - Creates feature views from real data
   - More resilient to missing test data

### Running Tests

```bash
# Full test suite
python3 test_feast_api_production.py

# Adaptive test with discovery
python3 test_feast_api_with_discovery.py

# Test specific endpoint
curl -X GET http://51.89.225.64/feast/status
```

## Conclusion

The Feast API is **operational** with core read endpoints working correctly. The main issues are:

1. ‚úÖ **Service Health:** Excellent - all infrastructure endpoints responding
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Configuration:** Needs S3 region configuration
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data:** Needs real tables or sample data for full workflow testing

**Next Steps:**

1. Fix S3 region configuration
2. Identify real gold layer tables
3. Create feature views from actual data
4. Re-run comprehensive tests
