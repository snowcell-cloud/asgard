## ✅ Working Endpoints (Verified)

### Core Feast Endpoints - All Working ✅

| Endpoint          | Method | Status | Response                            |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `/feast/status`   | GET    | ✅ 200 | Returns feature store configuration |
| `/feast/features` | GET    | ✅ 200 | Lists feature views (empty array)   |
| `/feast/models`   | GET    | ✅ 200 | Lists trained models (empty array)  |
| `/docs`           | GET    | ✅ 200 | Swagger UI documentation            |

### Current State

```json
{
  "registry_type": "local",
  "online_store_type": "disabled",
  "offline_store_type": "file (S3 Parquet - Iceberg native storage)",
  "num_feature_views": 0,
  "num_entities": 1,
  "num_feature_services": 0,
  "feature_views": [],
  "entities": ["customer_id"]
}
```

**Key Observations:**

- ✅ Feast service is operational
- ✅ Offline store configured (S3 Parquet + Iceberg)
- ✅ Online store disabled (as intended)
- ✅ One entity registered: `customer_id`
- ℹ️ No feature views created yet
- ℹ️ No models trained yet

## ⚠️ Endpoints with Issues

### 1. POST `/feast/features` - Create Feature View

**Status:** ❌ FAIL  
**Error:** AWS S3 Region Configuration Issue

```
Failed to create feature view: When getting information for key
'iceberg/gold/customer_aggregates/data/*.parquet' in bucket 'airbytedestination1':
AWS Error UNKNOWN (HTTP status 301) during HeadObject operation:
No response body. Looks like the configured region is '' while the bucket
is located in 'eu-north-1'.
```

**Root Cause:**

- S3 region not configured in Feast's `feature_store.yaml`
- Bucket `airbytedestination1` is in `eu-north-1`
- Feast trying to access with empty region string

**Fix:**

```yaml
# In /tmp/feast_repo/feature_store.yaml or FEAST_REPO_PATH
offline_store:
  type: file
  path: s3://airbytedestination1/iceberg/gold
  region: eu-north-1 # ADD THIS
```

---

### 2. POST `/feast/features/service` - Create Feature Service

**Status:** ❌ FAIL  
**Error:** Dependency on Feature View

```json
{
  "detail": "Feature view 'test_customer_features' not found"
}
```

**Root Cause:**

- Depends on successful feature view creation (endpoint #1)
- Will work once feature views are created

---

### 3. POST `/feast/models` - Train ML Model

**Status:** ❌ FAIL  
**Error:** Table Not Found

```
TrinoUserError(type=USER_ERROR, name=TABLE_NOT_FOUND,
message="line 6:18: Table 'iceberg.gold.customers' does not exist")
```

**Root Cause:**

- Test used non-existent table `iceberg.gold.customers`
- Need to use actual tables from gold layer

**Fix:**

- Query available tables first
- Use existing table names for training

---

### 4. POST `/feast/predictions/batch` - Batch Predictions

**Status:** ❌ FAIL  
**Error:** Model Not Found

```json
{
  "detail": "Model test-model-id not found"
}
```

**Root Cause:**

- Depends on successful model training (endpoint #3)
- Will work once models are trained

---

## 🔍 Test Scripts Created

Three comprehensive test scripts have been created:

### 1. `test_feast_api_production.py`

**Purpose:** Complete endpoint testing with predefined test data

**Features:**

- Tests all 7 Feast endpoints
- Includes API health check
- Detailed error reporting
- Color-coded output
- JSON request/response logging

**Run:**

```bash
python3 test_feast_api_production.py
```

---

### 2. `test_feast_api_with_discovery.py`

**Purpose:** Adaptive testing with table discovery

**Features:**

- Discovers available tables dynamically
- Creates feature views from real data
- Configuration analysis
- More resilient to missing data

**Run:**

```bash
python3 test_feast_api_with_discovery.py
```

---

### 3. `test_feast_api_quick.py`

**Purpose:** Quick health check of read-only endpoints

**Features:**

- Fast execution (< 1 minute)
- Tests all GET endpoints
- Minimal dependencies
- Good for CI/CD pipelines

**Run:**

```bash
python3 test_feast_api_quick.py
```

## 🔧 Required Fixes

### Priority 1: AWS S3 Region Configuration

**Issue:** Feast cannot access S3 without region configuration

**Fix Steps:**

1. Locate Feast configuration file:

   ```bash
   # Check environment variable
   echo $FEAST_REPO_PATH
   # Default: /tmp/feast_repo/feature_store.yaml
   ```

2. Edit `feature_store.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   project: asgard_features
   registry: data/registry.db
   provider: local

   offline_store:
     type: file
     path: s3://airbytedestination1/iceberg/gold
     region: eu-north-1 # ADD THIS LINE

   online_store:
     type: null
   ```

3. Restart the application:

   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart deployment asgard-app -n asgard
   ```

4. Verify fix:
   ```bash
   python3 test_feast_api_production.py
   ```

### Priority 2: Create Sample Feature Views

**Issue:** No feature views registered

**Solution:** Create feature views for existing gold tables

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://51.89.225.64/feast/features \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "customer_features",
    "entities": ["customer_id"],
    "features": [
      {"name": "total_orders", "dtype": "int64"},
      {"name": "total_spent", "dtype": "float64"}
    ],
    "source": {
      "table_name": "<real_table_name>",
      "timestamp_field": "created_at",
      "catalog": "iceberg",
      "schema": "gold"
    },
    "ttl_seconds": 86400,
    "online": false
  }'
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Fix S3 Configuration)**

   ```bash
   # Update feature_store.yaml with region
   # Restart deployment
   # Re-run tests
   ```

2. **Short Term (Setup Feature Views)**

   ```bash
   # Query available tables
   curl http://51.89.225.64/data-transformation/tables

   # Create feature views for real tables
   # Document feature definitions
   ```

3. **Medium Term (Model Training)**

   ```bash
   # Prepare training datasets
   # Train baseline models
   # Setup model versioning
   ```

4. **Long Term (Production Readiness)**
   - Move to persistent storage for models (S3)
   - Implement monitoring and alerting
   - Setup CI/CD for feature definitions
   - Add feature validation and testing

## 🏆 Conclusion

**Overall Assessment:** 🟡 PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL

**Positive:**

- ✅ Core Feast service is running and healthy
- ✅ All read endpoints working perfectly
- ✅ Proper architecture (offline-only with Iceberg)
- ✅ API documentation accessible
- ✅ One entity already configured

**Issues:**

- ⚠️ S3 region configuration missing (easy fix)
- ⚠️ No feature views or models yet (requires data setup)
- ⚠️ Test tables don't exist (need real table names)

**Recommendation:**
Fix the S3 region configuration and the Feast API will be fully operational for feature view creation and model training.
